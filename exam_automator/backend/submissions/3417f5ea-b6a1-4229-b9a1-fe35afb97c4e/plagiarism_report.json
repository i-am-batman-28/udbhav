    "### ASSESSMENT\nThe assessment of the plagiarism detection results indicates EXCELLENT ORIGINALITY, as the originality score is 100.0% and no significant similarity matches were detected.\n\n### DETAILED FINDINGS\nThe plagiarism detection results did not identify any significant matches in the following categories:\n- AI-Generated: No findings were detected, indicating that the submission does not contain any content that appears to be generated by artificial intelligence.\n- Internal Duplication: No findings were detected, suggesting that the submission does not contain any instances of internal duplication.\n- Exact Matches: No findings were detected, meaning that the submission does not contain any exact matches with other sources.\n- Paraphrasing: No findings were detected, indicating that the submission does not contain any paraphrased content that matches other sources.\n\nSince no significant matches were detected, there are no specific examples to cite, and confidence levels and severity are not applicable in this case.\n\n### REQUIRED ACTIONS\n1. Review the submission to ensure it meets the assignment requirements and is of high quality.\n2. Provide feedback to the student on their submission, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.\n3. Consider using this submission as an example of excellent original work in future classes or discussions on academic integrity.\n\n### BEST PRACTICES\n1. Regularly review and update assignment prompts to ensure they are clear and concise, reducing the likelihood of unintentional plagiarism.\n2. Encourage students to use version control systems, such as Git, to track changes and collaborations in their code submissions.\n3. Develop and communicate clear guidelines on acceptable collaboration and citation practices in coding assignments.\n4. Use plagiarism detection tools as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, instructor review and feedback on student submissions.\n\n### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS\nSince the originality score is not concerning, there is no need for a 5-step action plan to address a potential academic integrity issue. However, the instructor can still use this opportunity to reinforce the importance of academic integrity and provide guidance on best practices for coding assignments. The instructor may consider discussing the results with the student, providing feedback, and using this as a teaching moment to emphasize the value of original work and proper citation practices."
