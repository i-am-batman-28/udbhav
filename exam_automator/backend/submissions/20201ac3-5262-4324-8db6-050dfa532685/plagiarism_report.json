Consider using this submission as an example of excellent original work in future classes or discussions on academic integrity.\n\n### BEST PRACTICES\n1. Encourage students to use version control systems, such as Git, to track changes and collaborate on code assignments.\n2. Provide clear guidelines on what constitutes acceptable collaboration and independent work in coding assignments.\n3. Offer resources and support for students to learn about proper citation and referencing in code assignments.\n4. Regularly review and update assignment prompts to ensure they are clear, concise, and relevant to the course material.\n\n### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS\nSince the originality score is not concerning, there is no need for a 5-step action plan to address a potential issue. However, to maintain academic integrity and fairness, the instructor can:\n1. Continue to monitor student submissions for any potential issues.\n2. Provide regular feedback and guidance to students on academic integrity and proper citation practices.\n3. Review and update course materials and assignment prompts as needed.\n4.
