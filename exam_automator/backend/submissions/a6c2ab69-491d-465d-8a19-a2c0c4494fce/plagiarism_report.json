    "### ASSESSMENT\nThe assessment of the plagiarism detection results indicates EXCELLENT ORIGINALITY, as the originality score is 100.0% with no significant similarity matches detected.\n\n### DETAILED FINDINGS\nGiven the results, there are no categories with findings to break down, as the report indicates:\n- No AI-Generated content detected\n- No Internal Duplication detected\n- No Exact Matches detected\n- No Paraphrasing detected\n\nThe lack of any matches suggests that the student's submission is entirely original, with no evidence of plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration.\n\n### REQUIRED ACTIONS\n1. The instructor can proceed with grading the assignment based on its academic merit, as there are no plagiarism concerns.\n2. The instructor may consider providing feedback to the student on the quality of the code, including any suggestions for improvement, to enhance the student's learning experience.\n3. No further investigation into plagiarism is required based on these results.\n\n### BEST PRACTICES\n1. **Regularly Review Originality Reports**: Instructors should regularly review originality reports for all assignments to ensure academic integrity.\n2. **Provide Clear Guidelines**: Clearly communicate expectations regarding original work, collaboration, and the use of external resources to students.\n3. **Educate on Plagiarism**: Include educational components on what constitutes plagiarism, especially in coding assignments where similar algorithms can be independently developed.\n4. **Maintain Consistency**: Apply plagiarism detection tools consistently across all assignments and students to ensure fairness.\n\n### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS\nSince the originality score is not concerning, there is no need for a 5-step action plan to address plagiarism. However, for future reference, a general approach to addressing low originality scores could include:\n1. Reviewing the originality report in detail.\n2. Discussing the findings with the student to understand the context.\n3. Providing additional education on plagiarism and academic integrity.\n4. Considering the severity of the offense and the student's intent.\n5. Taking appropriate action based on the institution's policies, which could range from a warning to more severe academic penalties."
