    "### ASSESSMENT\nThe originality score of 100.0% indicates EXCELLENT ORIGINALITY, suggesting that the submission does not contain any significant similarity matches to existing sources. This assessment implies that the student's work is likely to be authentic and free from plagiarism.\n\n### DETAILED FINDINGS\nGiven the results, there are no significant findings to report as the plagiarism detection tool did not identify any matches. The categories to consider are:\n- **AI-Generated**: Not applicable, as there is no indication of AI-generated content.\n- **Internal Duplication**: Not applicable, as the tool did not detect any internal duplication.\n- **Exact Matches**: Not applicable, as there are no exact matches found.\n- **Paraphrasing**: Not applicable, as there is no evidence of paraphrased content from other sources.\n\nSince there are no findings, there are no specific examples to cite, and confidence levels and severity are not applicable in this context.\n\n### REQUIRED ACTIONS\n1. **No further action is required** regarding plagiarism, as the originality score is 100.0% and no significant similarity matches were detected.\n2. **Review the submission for content understanding and accuracy**, ensuring that the code meets the assignment's requirements and is correctly implemented.\n3. **Provide feedback to the student** on their work, focusing on aspects such as code quality, efficiency, and adherence to best practices in coding.\n\n### BEST PRACTICES\n1. **Regularly use plagiarism detection tools** for code submissions to maintain academic integrity and ensure original work.\n2. **Encourage students to comment their code**, making it easier to understand their thought process and implementation decisions.\n3. **Teach best practices in coding**, including proper citation of sources if any code snippets are used from external sources, even if modified.\n4. **Foster a culture of originality and innovation**, encouraging students to develop their own solutions to problems rather than relying on existing ones.\n\n### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS\nSince the originality score is not concerning, the recommended next steps focus on general academic integrity and feedback:\n1. **Maintain records** of the plagiarism detection results for future reference.\n2. **Continue to educate students** on the importance of academic integrity and original work.\n3. **Review and update assignment guidelines** to ensure they are clear and concise, reducing the likelihood of unintentional plagiarism.\n4. **Provide constructive feedback** to students on their submissions, helping them improve their work and understanding of the subject matter.\n5. **Monitor future submissions** for any changes in originality scores, addressing any concerns promptly to uphold academic integrity standards."
