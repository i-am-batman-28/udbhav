The assessment of the plagiarism detection results indicates EXCELLENT ORIGINALITY, as the originality score is 100.0% and no significant similarity matches were detected.

### DETAILED FINDINGS
The plagiarism detection results did not identify any significant matches or concerns in the following categories:
- AI-Generated: No findings were reported, indicating that the submission does not appear to contain AI-generated content.
- Internal Duplication: No internal duplication was detected, suggesting that the student did not reuse their own work inappropriately.
- Exact Matches: No exact matches were found, meaning that the submission does not contain any identical code or text from other sources.
- Paraphrasing: No paraphrased content was detected, indicating that the student did not attempt to disguise existing work as their own.
