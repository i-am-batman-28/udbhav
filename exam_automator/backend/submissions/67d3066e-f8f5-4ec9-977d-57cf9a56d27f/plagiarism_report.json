    "### ASSESSMENT\nThe assessment of the plagiarism detection results indicates EXCELLENT ORIGINALITY, as the originality score is 100.0% and no significant similarity matches were detected.\n\n### DETAILED FINDINGS\nThe plagiarism detection results did not identify any significant concerns in the following categories:\n- AI-Generated: No findings were detected, indicating that the submission does not appear to be generated by artificial intelligence.\n- Internal Duplication: No findings were detected, suggesting that the submission does not contain significant internal duplication.\n- Exact Matches: No findings were detected, meaning that the submission does not contain exact matches with other sources.\n- Paraphrasing: No findings were detected, indicating that the submission does not contain paraphrased content from other sources.\n\nSince no specific examples or matches were detected, there are no confidence levels or severity notes to report.\n\n### REQUIRED ACTIONS\n1. Review the submission to ensure it meets the assignment requirements and grading criteria.\n2. Provide feedback to the student on their submission, focusing on the quality of the code, adherence to coding standards, and any areas for improvement.\n3. Consider using this opportunity to discuss the importance of academic integrity and originality in coding assignments.\n\n### BEST PRACTICES\n1. **Clear Assignment Guidelines**: Ensure that assignment guidelines clearly outline expectations for originality, collaboration, and the use of external resources.\n2. **Code Review**: Regularly review student code submissions to provide constructive feedback and guidance on coding standards and best practices.\n3. **Academic Integrity Education**: Incorporate discussions on academic integrity and the importance of original work in coding assignments to promote a culture of honesty and authenticity.\n4. **Similarity Detection Tools**: Utilize plagiarism detection tools specifically designed for code to help identify potential issues and maintain academic integrity.\n\n### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS\nSince the originality score is not concerning, there is no need for a 5-step action plan to address a potential issue. However, to maintain academic integrity and fairness, the instructor should continue to:\n- Monitor student submissions for any signs of academic dishonesty.\n- Provide clear guidelines and expectations for future assignments.\n- Offer support and resources to students to help them understand the importance of originality and academic integrity in coding assignments.\n- Regularly review and update assignment guidelines to ensure they are relevant and effective in promoting academic integrity.\n- Consider providing additional training or resources to students on proper coding practices and academic integrity."
