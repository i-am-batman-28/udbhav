Provide feedback to the student on their work, focusing on content, structure, and any areas for improvement.\n3. Consider using this opportunity to discuss the importance of originality and proper citation in academic and professional coding practices.\n\n### BEST PRACTICES\n1. **Clear Assignment Guidelines**: Ensure that assignment guidelines clearly outline expectations for original work and proper citation practices.\n2. **Code Review**: Regularly review student code submissions to provide constructive feedback and to reinforce good coding practices.\n3. **Academic Integrity Education**: Incorporate discussions on academic integrity, including what constitutes plagiarism in coding, into the curriculum to promote a culture of original work.\n4. **Utilize Plagiarism Detection Tools**: Consistently use plagiarism detection tools as part of the grading process to maintain fairness and to identify any potential issues early.\n\n### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS\nSince the originality score is not concerning, the recommended next steps focus on maintaining academic integrity and providing quality feedback:\n1.
