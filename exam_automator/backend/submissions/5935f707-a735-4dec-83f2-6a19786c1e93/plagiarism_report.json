    "### ASSESSMENT\nThe plagiarism detection results indicate a HIGH RISK of academic integrity concerns, given the low originality score of 20.0% and the detection of AI-generated content.\n\n### DETAILED FINDINGS\nThe plagiarism detection results reveal the following findings:\n- **AI-Generated Content**: The detection of AI-generated content in the submission is a significant concern. With a confidence level of 80.0%, it suggests that a substantial portion of the code may have been generated using artificial intelligence tools. This is a serious issue, as it may indicate that the student did not independently complete the assignment. The sample provided in the findings is not specified, but the high confidence level implies that the detected content is likely to be AI-generated.\n\n### REQUIRED ACTIONS\n1. Review the assignment submission and the detected AI-generated content to understand the extent of the issue.\n2. Meet with the student to discuss the findings and determine whether the student understands the implications of using AI-generated content in their work.\n3. Evaluate the student's knowledge of the subject matter by administering an oral or written examination to assess their understanding of the code and algorithms used in the assignment.\n4. Consider requesting the student to resubmit the assignment, ensuring that they understand the expectations for original work and the consequences of using AI-generated content without proper citation or disclosure.\n\n### BEST PRACTICES\n1. Clearly communicate the expectations for original work and the use of AI-generated content in assignments, ensuring that students understand the implications of using such tools.\n2. Provide guidance on proper citation and disclosure of AI-generated content, if allowed, to maintain academic integrity.\n3. Regularly review and update assignments to minimize the likelihood of students using AI-generated content, focusing on unique and creative problem-solving tasks.\n4. Educate students on the importance of academic integrity and the consequences of violating it, promoting a culture of originality and honesty.\n\n### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS\nGiven the concerning originality score, the following 5-step action plan is recommended:\n1. **Document the findings**: Record the plagiarism detection results, including the originality score and the detected AI-generated content, to maintain a clear record of the incident.\n2. **Meet with the student**: Discuss the findings with the student, ensuring they understand the implications of using AI-generated content and the expectations for original work.\n3. **Assess the student's understanding**: Evaluate the student's knowledge of the subject matter through an oral or written examination to determine their level of understanding.\n4. **Determine the appropriate course of action**: Based on the student's response and understanding, decide whether to accept the submission, request a resubmission, or take further action, such as referring the incident to the academic integrity committee.\n5. **Reflect and revise**: Review the assignment and the detection results to identify areas for improvement, revising the assignment and instructions as needed to minimize the likelihood of future incidents and promote academic integrity."
